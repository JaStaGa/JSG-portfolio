# JSG Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site. It is where I bring together my projects, skills, and experience in one place, but I also wanted it to be something that feels alive when you visit. Everything you see here was built with a mix of clean design and a few special effects to make it stand out.

## What makes it unique

### Dark mode first
The site loads in dark mode every time unless you decide otherwise. I designed the color palette so it feels sharp and modern. Your choice is remembered so it stays the way you set it.

### Interactive background
There is a canvas element in the background with moving particles that connect when they get close. It adds a layer of movement without distracting from the content. If your device has reduced motion preferences on, it respects that and stays still.

### Smooth section reveals
As you scroll, sections fade and slide in. This is done using the Intersection Observer API, which only triggers the animation when a section actually enters the screen.

### Hero section
The first thing you see is a split layout. On one side is my name, a short tagline, and two buttons: one to view my projects and one to download my resume. On the other side is my profile picture framed inside a glowing container.

### Subtle 3D tilt
Move your mouse over certain elements and they tilt slightly to give a 3D effect. If you are navigating with a keyboard, they will scale up a little instead so it still feels interactive.

### Project cards
Each project has its own card with a thumbnail, title, description, and tech chips that show what tools and technologies were used. On hover, the cards lift up and cast a stronger shadow.

### Fully responsive
Everything is built with CSS Grid and Flexbox so it works well on any screen size. On smaller screens, the hero section stacks, the navigation wraps neatly, and the skills list reorganizes itself.

### Light mode polish
If you prefer light mode, it is not just a color inversion. The background has a pale green tint to make it softer on the eyes. The navbar stays dark for contrast and buttons adjust so they still stand out.

## Tools and technologies

HTML5 for the structure

CSS3 for layout and design including custom properties, Flexbox, Grid, and media queries

JavaScript for the interactive features including the dark mode toggle, section reveal animations, particle background, and 3D tilt effect

Google Fonts Montserrat for headings and Roboto for body text
